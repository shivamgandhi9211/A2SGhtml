                Basketball is a team sport in which two teams, most commonly of five players each, opposing one another
                on a rectangular court, compete with the primary objective of shooting a basketball.

                A field goal is worth two points, unless made from behind the three-point line, when it is worth three.
                After a foul, timed play stops and the player fouled or designated to shoot a technical foul is given
                one, two or three one-point free throws.
